this is the information page

here I have created a new folder called partials.
This folder will contain the files which are necessary in other main files.

I have also installed the handlebars third party templates that offers a more features than built-in one
After installing the handlebars third party templates, we have to now require the that module in app.js files
and modify the code i.e.
app.engine('.hbs', expressHbs({defaultLayout: 'layout', extname: '.hbs'}));
app.set('view engine', '.hbs');

old code is
// view engine setup
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
app.set('view engine', 'hbs');
